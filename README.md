# CodeChallenge4
Flipping a Bit(binary digit) means changing from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0.An Operation OP(i) of bit flipping is defined on a binary number as follows.Performing OP(i) would result into flipping of each ith bit from the starting(i>0)

Inout Specifications:
•	Binary Numbers(as string):B
•	Integer :j were (j>0)
•	Integer: k where (k>0)

Output Specification:
Number of bits will remain the same after applying these two operations(integer)
Or 
-1 in case of invalid values of j,k or both
